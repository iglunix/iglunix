# [Iglunix](https://iglunix.xyz/)
Unix like software distribution with no GNU components

All build scripts are 0BSD Licensed.

To create an ISO from a non-iglunix OS please see https://github.com/iglunix/iglunix-autobuild

## Is this GNU/Linux
No, GNU currently contributes roughly 10 MiB of code in the base system whilst,
LLVM and Linux both contribute approximately 1 GiB each. Instead we suggest that
one should refer to Igluinx running on the Linux kernel as LLVM/Musl/Linux.
LLVM and Linux because they are the two largest packages and make up the
majority of the base system, and Musl to be explicit about the C library,
target triple and to differentiate it from any system using LLVM's libc
(which will may very well likely use in the future).

## Status of Other Kernels

### FreeBSD
FreeBSD has solid upstream LLVM support which would make it ideal for iglunix.
However, I haven't been successful at building the required parts of the base
system.

### OpenBSD
Iglunix has been tested to work on OpenBSD. (don't forget to symlink `libc.so`
otherwise the toolchain breaks).

### Darwin
I have found no easy way of building libc on Darwin platforms as on yet.
Because of this I haven't got far at all porting Iglunix to Darwin
based systems such as MacOS and PureDarwin.

## Web Browsers
Iglunix currently has qtwebengine running (with sandboxing broken on at least
aarch64). This does require 3 extra GNU dependencies on top of GNU Make:
`gperf`, `gm4`, `bison`. This also requires dbus however it is only needed
at build time and for this reason we are working on a stub implementation.

## TODO (lots more TODO items in the Discord)
 - LLVM (Work out how to split packages)
 - QEMU for multiarch (need lots of work on glibr to get this to build)
